Getting atom to open in x2go had some issues.

https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4360

Used the forum above to get the issue resolved.  Basically added these two lines to my Dockerfile:
  cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1 /usr/share/atom/ && \
  sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' /usr/share/atom/libxcb.so.1

The Dockerfile contains a step that copies the startapp.sh file to the image.  Whatever is in the startapp.sh will be executed when the contain is spin up.  Right now it's set to open atom with the /saved folder as it's starting project.

Wants:
Expose atom's package folder to add packages to atom
Automate build when a new atom version is available
Create better README.md instructions explaining all the things
